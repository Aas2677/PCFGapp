A Web tool for exploring PCFGs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar).
You can explore the topic and use the tool to find the N-best parses,total probability and total number of parses for an input string in a user defined grammar.
You can run the app locally using Python and Flask, or it is available at https://www.grammarexplorer.org.
The code is not strucutred or intended as a public library, but you could clone the grammar and parsing modules for your own purposes.
